## My process

This project is the culmination of a learning process where we wanted to test what was learned through it. At the same time, a reinforcement 
to become more familiar with the project creation architectures, which helped me to better understand the operation of the project and the 
management of the information that is handled within it. This helps me to acquire more confidence with the handling of different tools for 
frontend development, taking into account that a project was started from scratch and ends with the start of production, helped by a server 
such as netlify, which helped me to give life to this small project and feel closer to feeling how it works within a company.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties - Sass
- Javascript ES6
- OOP paradigm
- Architecture project creation
- Project Deploy

### What I learned


This project helped me feel more confident in my knowledge about javascript understanding how javascript works behind the scenes, which gives me 
a feeling that things don't just happen by magic but knowing how that magic happens and this project has helped me Given that confidence that 
I will develop more along with other projects, it also gave me the opportunity to improve my skills as a programmer.

## Acknowledgments

I am very happy to continue advancing in this learning process, I know that for each person in this world of programming it is different, 
some of us take more time than others, but the important thing is that if something that we are passionate about is something that we must follow and if 
it is something that you have fun it is not work. I just know that every step that i have took are taking me to a better place
